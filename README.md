Financial text classification

Every day thousands of financial news articles and blogs are published on the internet.
These articles contain valuable information and insights for business companies and individuals,
especially those who are interested in the stock market. We are definitely not
interested in all of the published articles, and practically it is not feasible to go through
every one of them to choose the interesting articles. So to make use of this data, we 
need to identify and sort out valuable information in it. This is precisely what we are trying
to do. The first step is collecting financial news articles (I am currency focusing only on
news articles) from the internet and storing them in a database in an organised manner.

to filter that out. After that, we need to capture and organise the relevant information.

â€¢ Investment, Acquisition, Merger, Joint venture, Partnership and Lawsuit
